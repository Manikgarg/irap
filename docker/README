Pre-built docker images with iRAP (based on Ubuntu and Fedora) are
available in the docker hub
(https://hub.docker.com/u/nunofonseca/). The docker files used to
create the images are available in the current (sub)folder(s).  

An example of a script to run iRAP in a docker container is provided
in the file irap_docker.

Information about how to install and use docker is available at
http://docs.docker.com/.
